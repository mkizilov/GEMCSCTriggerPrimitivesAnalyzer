# GEMCSCTriggerPrimitivesAnalyzer
This is the tool for analyzing performance of GEMCSC Trigger Primitives [emulator](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/master/L1Trigger/CSCTriggerPrimitives).  
It takes as an input .root output from [GEMCSCTP Reader](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/master/L1Trigger/CSCTriggerPrimitives/plugins). You need to turn a reader option on before running emulator to create this file.  
# Usage
See example.  
You can run it on CERN SWAN. If you want to run it locally you need to have numpy, pandas, matplotlib and uproot.
